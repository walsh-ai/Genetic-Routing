# Genetic-Routing
This project builds on existing literature to develop a Genetic Algorithm with Immigrant schemes to solve the Dynamic Shortest Path Routing Problem (DSPRP) and examines its performance across random graph topologies with a range of relevant statistical properties with realistic stochastic dynamics.
