This folder contains (possibly not all) plots drawn in the Python scripts for this project. 

Dynamics analysis: This folder contains plots drawn in analysis of the topological characteristics (e.g. average pathlength) of the random graph stochastic dynamics designed in this project effecting the edges, nodes and edge weights of the random graphs. 

Experiments: This folder contains plots evaluating the performance of different configurations of the GA, regarded as experiments. E.g. Hypothesis: The GA will perform best with a mutation rate seen in a given paper, test: run with a range of mutation rates and evaluate accuracy. 

Simulations: This folder contains plots showing the performance of the final GA configurations over the investigated static/dynamic random graph topologies. 

Genetic algorithm: This folder contains plots drawn in the scripts implementing the GA configurations
